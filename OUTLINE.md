# Outline

A prospective outline for the game, likely to evolve and change over time.

Inspiration for `cprl` comes from the wealth of Cyberpunk media created since the 1980s, in particular drawing heavily from [Akira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akira_(franchise)), [Neuromancer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromancer), [the Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Matrix), [Tron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron) and [Caves of Qud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caves_of_Qud).

## Setting
A sprawling future metropolis, the City, dominated by greedy megacorporations...

A universal computer network, *cyberspace*, which can be accessed as an alternate, augmented reality...

Biker gangs, hackers, cyborgs, rogue AIs, private militaries, secretive organisations...

Telekinetic powers, cybernetic modifications, futuristic weaponry...

## Player character
The player is an adult human who develops Esper abilities as the game progresses. There is no class system; instead players can customise their character through their physical attributes, mental attributes, hardware and software.

Vitality attributes:
- Constitution – determines health
- Brawn – determines armour capacity

Physical attributes:
- Strength – determines melee weapon ability
- Dexterity – determines ranged weapon ability

Mental attributes:
- Tenacity – determines contact-based psychic ability
- Potentiality – determines ranged telekinetic ability

Hardware:
- Adaptability – determines cybernetic modification capacity
- Attunement – determines modification effectiveness

Software:
- Penetration – determines destructive hacking ability
- Security – determines defensive anti-hacking ability

## Factions
At the start of the game, the player will choose to align themself with a particular faction, which determine the nature of NPC interactions throughout the game. These factions include:

- Yakuza gangs
- Biker gangs
- Cultists
- Corporate militaries
- Government agencies

## Locations
A fixed overworld with pre-designed locations in the City including:

- Blue Cafe Hotel – a "home" location for the player for storing items and interfacing with cyberspace
- the Bazaar – an exotic marketplace ideal for buying and selling goods, and signing on to new quests
- Akuma-Druden Corporation HQ – the end-game location

Randomly generated locations including:

- Cyberspace
- The City's underbelly
- Corporation headquarters

## Goals
The end-goal will be to take down Akuma-Druden Corp at their headquarters (a pre-designed location). However in order to feasibly achieve that goal the player will need to advance their abilities by performing randomly-generated quests such as:

- Hacking corporations – industrial espionage in randomly generated cyberspace locations
- Interpersonal visits – finding, assassinating, protecting, rescuing, kidnapping in randomly generated underbelly locations
- Industrial espionage – infiltrating randomly generated corporate headquarters

## Gameplay
A fairly traditional Rogue-like:

- Turn-based
- ASCII tileset
- Keyboard-driven control scheme
- Permadeath

But perhaps flexibility to be more modern:

- Optional graphical tilesets
- Optional mouse-driven control scheme
- Optional save/load functionality

The randomly generated quests should scale to the player's current abilities, providing both challenge and opportunity for advancement. The pre-designed quests (e.g. the end-game) will have a fixed difficulty threshold.

Further ideas:

- Control of more than one character? For example during a given quest, have different stages executed by different characters.
- Rare events? For example highly unlikely glitches in cyberspace with profound gameplay consequences?
- Faction history/evolution? Something akin to Dwarf Fortress, with factions evolving in the background as the user plays?
